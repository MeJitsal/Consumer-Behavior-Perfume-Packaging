# Consumer-Behavior-Perfume-Packaging
This project examines the impact of color vs. black-and-white packaging on Dior perfume purchase intent in NYC. Using surveys and simulation data for 384 participants, it analyzes attention, interest, and purchase behavior. Results offer insights into packaging design's influence on luxury consumer behavior.


This project analyzes the impact of color versus black-and-white product packaging on consumers' purchase intent, with a focus on potential Dior perfume consumers in New York City. The research targets adults who can afford luxury goods, including Diorâ€™s current and prospective customers. Through a stratified sampling approach, surveys are distributed both in Dior's physical stores and online, allowing for representation across different customer segments. Participants are incentivized with early access to a Dior product launch.

The project measures variables such as attention to packaging, interest, compelled to purchase, and actual purchase behavior. The primary outcome is whether participants make a purchase based on packaging design. Additionally, I coded simulation data to estimate various outcomes and validate the robustness of the sample size and statistical power assumptions.
